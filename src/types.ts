 * after the fact — there is no `addHandler()`/`on()` method.
 *
 * - **Exclusivity**: one subscription delivers each event to one listener
 *   only. Events are never fanned out to multiple handlers of the same
 *   subscription. If you need several consumers, call
 *   `subscribeToEvents()` once per consumer and give each subscription its own
 *   listener; each subscription then receives its own copy of the stream.
 * - **Ordering**: events are delivered to the listener in the order the
 *   network produced them — ascending ledger sequence, and within a ledger,
 *   ascending event order. Delivery is strictly sequential: the next event is
 *   not dispatched until the listener for the previous one has returned.
 * - **Error isolation**: if the listener throws, the failure is contained to
 *   that single event. The subscription stays open, the remaining events in
 *   the same batch are still delivered, and the error is reported through
 *   `EventSubscriptionOptions.onError`. This holds for both the WebSocket and
